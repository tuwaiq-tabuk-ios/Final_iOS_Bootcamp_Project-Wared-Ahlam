Blood donation app

## Motivation
"Donating blood helps protect your heart!  Studies have shown that “those who donate their blood at least once a year, they are less likely to have circulatory diseases and leukemia.																									
What if an application encouraged you to donate blood and made you see the nearest hospital branch to donate and book an appointment to donate?  
What if you saved a lot of lives when you donated blood? 
This application helps many, many people and hospitals to help those in need of your blood!"
